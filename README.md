Started on 12/26/2024 - Testing setup and haven't uploaded much.

This repository contains a random collection of python and matlab scripts used to analyze coastal and ocean data.
These scripts rely on various other open source toolboxes that require installation. 
Plan to organize and clean up over time.

Note these are mostly being uploaded for backup and version control for myself, these scripts may have some useful
examples but will require the user to update as needed (ie directories, data files, etc). At some point
I may orgniaze correctly so scripts run as is...
